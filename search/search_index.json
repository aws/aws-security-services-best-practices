Certificate-based signatures use digital certificates issued by a certificate authority (CA) to link a signature to a specific identity, validating the identity of the signer.

The public key becomes part of the certificate, while ACM uses KMS to encrypt the private key with an encryption context. ACM then stores the certificate and its corresponding encrypted private key. AWS uses the same KMS key to encrypt private keys for all certificates in a specific AWS account and region, with all KMS calls handled internally by ACM.</p> <p>KMS cryptographic operations with symmetric encryption keys accept an encryption context\u2014an optional set of non-secret key-value pairs containing additional contextual information about the data. This context can be inserted into KMS Encrypt operations to enhance the audibility of API decryption calls. ACM automatically sets the context with values including the certificate ARN of the private key being encrypted, the AWS Region, and the Account ID, which are then cryptographically bound to the ciphertext. The unique encryption context for every ACM certificate creates a logical isolation between certificates.</p> <p>Important considerations for ACM public certificates include:</p> <ul> <li>They cannot directly access KMS operations</li> <li>You cannot modify how ACM calls KMS</li> <li>You are unable to modify the encryption context</li> <li>You are prohibited from exporting the private key of a public certificate</li> </ul>"},{"location":"guides/certificate-services/#aws-cloudformation-considerations","title":"AWS CloudFormation considerations","text":"<p>With AWS CloudFormation you can create a template that describes the AWS resources that you want to use.

If you use AWS CloudFormation to quickly create and delete multiple test environments, we recommend that you do not create a separate ACM certificate for each environment. Doing so could exhaust your certificate quota. Instead, create a wildcard certificate that covers all of the domain names that you are using for testing. For example, if you repeatedly create ACM certificates for domain names that vary by only a version number, such as \\.service.example.com, create instead a single wildcard certificate for &lt;*&gt;.service.example.com. Include the wildcard certificate in the template that AWS CloudFormation uses to create your test environment. <p>When using AWS CloudFormation to request a certificate, domain validation is only handled under specific conditions: the domain must be hosted in Amazon Route 53, reside in your AWS account, and use DNS validation.

Renewal notices are sent to five common system addresses for the requested domain  (e.g., admin or postmaster) starting 45 days before expiration. These certificates require manual approval from the domain owner. All listed domains must be validated for a renewed certificate with the same ARN to be issued, which can introduce potential errors or delays if email configurations are incorrect.</p>"},{"location":"guides/certificate-services/#domain-name-considerations","title":"Domain name considerations","text":"<p>ACM certificates can secure singular domain names, multiple specific domain names, wildcard domains (protecting an unlimited number of subdomains), or any combination of these. Once created, certificates cannot be modified by adding or removing domain names. To make changes, you must request a new certificate with the entire revised list of domain names, validating ownership of all domains, including previously validated names.</p> <p>You cannot add or remove domain names from an existing ACM certificate. Instead you must request a new certificate with the revised list of domain names. For example, if your certificate has five domain names and you want to add four more, you must request a new certificate with all nine domain names. As with any new certificate, you must validate ownership of all the domain names in the request, including the names that you previously validated for the original certificate.</p> <p>If you use email validation, you receive up to 8 validation email messages for each domain, at least 1 of which must be acted upon within 72 hours. For example, when you request a certificate with five domain names, you receive up to 40 validation messages, at least 5 of which must be acted upon within 72 hours. As the number of domain names in the certificate request increases, so does the work required to use email to validate domain ownership.</p> <p>If you use DNS validation instead, you must write one new DNS record to the database for the FQDN you want to validate. ACM sends you the record to create and later queries the database to determine whether the record has been added. Adding the record asserts that you own or control the domain. In the preceding example, if you request a certificate with five domain names, you must create five DNS records. We recommend that you use DNS validation when possible.</p>"},{"location":"guides/certificate-services/#controlling-access-to-acm-certificates","title":"Controlling access to ACM certificates","text":"<p>Unlike other data protection services like KMS or Secrets Manager, ACM does not support resource policies or resource control policies (RCPs). Instead, access to ACM certificates can be controlled through either identity-based IAM policies, or service control policies (SCPs) if using AWS Organizations.</p> <p>Use account-level separation in your policies to control who can access certificates at an account level. Keep your production certificates in separate accounts than your testing and development certificates. If you can't use account-level separation, you can restrict access to specific roles by denying the kms:CreateGrant action  in your policies for the KMS key that protects the certificate private key. This limits which roles in an account can sign or use certificates at a high level. For information about grants, including grant terminology, see Grants in AWS KMS in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.</p> <p>If you want more granular control than restricting the use of <code>kms:CreateGrant</code> by account, you can limit <code>kms:CreateGrant</code> to specific certificates using <code>kms:EncryptionContext</code> condition keys. Specify <code>arn:aws:acm</code> as the key, and the value of the ARN to restrict.

Instead of verifying the entire certificate chain from root CA downward, the application only trusts a pre-defined certificate or key for that host. This trusted certificate can be embedded during development or captured during the first connection to the host.</p> <p>We recommend that your application not pin an ACM certificate. ACM performs managed certificate renewal in AWS Certificate Manager to automatically renew your Amazon-issued SSL/TLS certificates before they expire. To renew a certificate, ACM generates a new public-private key pair. If your application pins the ACM certificate and the certificate is successfully renewed with a new public key, the application might be unable to connect to your domain.</p> <p>If you decide to pin a certificate, the following options will not hinder your application from connecting to your domain:</p> <ul> <li>Import your own certificate into ACM and then pin your application to the imported certificate.

If a threat actor is attempting to compromise your AWS environment, they typically perform a sequence of actions that lead to multiple security findings and unusual behaviors. These actions are often spread across time and entities. When security findings are investigated in isolation, it can lead to a misinterpretation of their significance and difficulty in finding the root cause. Amazon Detective addresses this problem by applying a graph analysis technique that infers relationships between findings and entities, and groups them together. We recommend treating Finding Groups as the starting point for investigating the involved entities and findings. While GuardDuty can show you the threat event, Detective can tell you the story of what else happened in the environment related to the event.</p> <p>When we first navigate to a Finding Group (example image below), we can see that we are presented with a generative AI powered summary of the Finding Group. This gives us an understanding of the activity associated with the Finding Group before we even dive into the data.</p> <p> Figure 14: Detective generative AI Finding Group summary</p> <p>Detective will attempt to correlate threat events and resources to the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework. MITRE publishes a matrix of Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) that malicious actors perform when attacking a system. These correlated TTPs are published by Detective into a Finding Group. This is a visual representation of the events, resources, and security findings that make up an event.</p> <p></p> <p>Figure 15: TTPs associated with Detective Finding Group</p> <p>The Finding Group is represented by this generated graph that provides a visualization of associated resources and how they are connected. In this example, there are many different IP addresses associated with a brute force GuardDuty finding, and some of these resources are associated with other GuardDuty findings, like this Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) request. DGAs are used to periodically generate a large number of domain names that can be used as rendezvous points with their command and control (C&amp;C) servers. During a GuardDuty finding investigation, it might not be clear that there are other resources included in the overall security issue. Detective Finding Groups help connect these dots.</p> <p></p> <p>Figure 16: Detective Finding Group graph visualization</p> <p>Use these Finding Groups to investigate other IPs, EC2s, or AWS accounts from where an attack originated or continued onto.</p> <p>The data correlating events to resources is available in raw data if you are collecting these data sources individually, but security analysts need to know how to craft individual queries to crawl through logs and then graph to a visualization tool later. Detective short-circuits this investigative effort and query generation activity. While most customers don\u2019t replace their traditional SIEM tools with Detective, the use of Detective with a SIEM is effective at reducing investigation times.</p> <p>Compare Detective's effectiveness to collecting and aggregating your logs separately.

If potential malicious activity, such as anomalous behavior, credential exfiltration, or command and control infrastructure (C2) communication is detected, GuardDuty generates detailed security findings that can be used for security visibility and assisting in remediation. Additionally, using the Amazon GuardDuty Malware Protection feature helps to detect malicious files on Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes attached to Amazon EC2 instance and container workloads.</p> <p>GuardDuty monitors Foundational data sources such as AWS CloudTrail event logs, AWS CloudTrail management events, Amazon VPC Flow Logs, and DNS logs. Enablement of the Foundational data sources is not required. Amazon GuardDuty pulls independent streams of data directly from those services.</p> <p>In addition to the foundational data sources, GuardDuty can use additional data from other AWS services in your AWS environment to monitor and provide analysis for potential security threats. Those services include:</p> <ul> <li>Amazon EKS \u2013 GuardDuty monitors EKS Audit Logs and operating system-level events via the GuardDuty security agent.</li> <li>AWS Lambda \u2013 GuardDuty monitors network activity logs, including VPC Flow Logs for suspicious network traffic.</li> <li>Amazon EC2 and Containers \u2013 GuardDuty monitors its findings for indicators of malware presence on attached Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes, e.g. bitcoin mining activity.</li> <li>Amazon Aurora \u2013 GuardDuty monitors and profiles relational database service login activity for potential threats.</li> <li>Amazon S3 \u2013 GuardDuty monitors AWS CloudTrail S3 data events to identify potential threats in your Amazon S3 resources.

When an S3 object or a new version of an existing S3 object gets uploaded to your selected bucket, GuardDuty automatically starts a malware scan. It is important to note that S3 malware protection is not intended to be deployed across your entire S3 estate. S3 Malware protection is purpose built to provide a cost effective solution that will scan objects that are uploaded to untrusted buckets.

Some of the findings may be deemed low value or threats not intended to be acted upon. To make it easier to recognize security threats that are most impactful to your environment, enabling quick remediation actions, it is recommended to deploy suppression rules. A suppression rule is a set of criteria, consisting of a filter attribute paired with a value, used to filter findings by automatically archiving new findings that match the specified criteria.</p> <p>After creating a suppression rule, new findings that match the criteria defined in the rule are automatically archived as long as the suppression rule is in place. Existing filters can be used to create suppression rules. Suppression rules can be configured to suppress entire finding types, or define more granular filter criteria to suppress only specific instances of a particular finding type. Suppression rules can be edited at any time. It is recommended to suppress with as much granularity as possible. This will help with reducing findings for only certain circumstances without losing total coverage of a finding type.</p> <p>Suppressed findings are not sent to AWS Security Hub, Amazon S3, Amazon Detective, or Amazon CloudWatch, reducing finding noise level if you consume GuardDuty findings via Security Hub, a third-party SIEM, or other alerting and ticketing applications.</p> <p>GuardDuty continues to generate findings even when they match suppression rules, however, those findings are automatically marked as archived. An archived finding is stored in GuardDuty for 90-days and can be viewed at any time during that period. You can view suppressed findings in the GuardDuty console by selecting Archived from the findings table, or through the GuardDuty API using the ListFindings API with a findingCriteria criterion of service.archived equal to true.</p> <p>A common use case for a suppression rule is filtering out a known resource that scans EC2 instances. This resource may result in a finding type Recon:EC2/Portscan which for certain resources in your environment may be intended. For this scenario it is recommended to suppress associated findings using a combination of resource tagging and Finding Type.</p>"},{"location":"guides/guardduty/#automated-notification-for-high-priority-findings","title":"Automated notification for high priority findings","text":"<p>After creating suppression rule filters to allow for surfacing only the most impactful findings for your environment, the next recommended action is automating the notification of high priority findings. Amazon EventBridge is a serverless event bus that makes it easier to build event-driven applications at scale using events generated from AWS services. GuardDuty creates an event for Amazon EventBridge for newly generated findings. All findings are dynamic, meaning that, if GuardDuty detects new activity related to the same security issue it will update the original finding with the new information as a newly aggregated finding. Thus, creating a new event for EventBridge to potentially process. Delegated administrators can optionally change the frequency of publishing new findings to EventBridge in GuardDuty Settings under Findings export options. By default, EventBridge is updated every 6 hours but can be changed to 1 hour or 15 minutes intervals.</p> <p>Every GuardDuty finding is assigned a finding ID. GuardDuty creates an EventBridge event for every finding with a unique finding ID.  By using Amazon EventBridge with GuardDuty, you can automate tasks to help you respond to security issues related to GuardDuty findings. One such task is sending notifications to a preferred notification channel. Commonly used notification channels are email and Enterprise messaging applications that support incoming messages via Webhook.</p> <p>Another common scenario is to send GuardDuty findings to a ticketing system or SIEM solution for tracking and event correlation. It is recommended to leverage Security Hub as a central aggregation point in AWS for security findings before sending these findings to a ticketing system or SIEM solution. You can also leverage EventBridge to send GuardDuty findings directly to a ticketing system or SIEM solution. Please refer to your solutions documentation for guidance on how to send information via EventBridge.</p> <p>When leveraging email as a preferred notification channel, GuardDuty is integrated with Amazon Simple Notification Services (Amazon SNS) via EventBridge. Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a fully managed messaging service for both application-to-application (A2A) and application-to-person (A2P) communication. The notification workflow is as depicted in the image below.  Figure 12: GuardDuty notification workflow</p> <p>All GuardDuty findings not matching a suppression rule are automatically delivered to the account event bus. There are only two configurations required to deploy email notification via Amazon SNS for unsuppressed findings:</p> <ol> <li>Create and subscribe to a SNS topic</li> <li>Create an EventBridge rule</li> </ol> <p>SNS is the target service for EventBridge actions in this workflow. SNS only requires two steps: 1. Create a new Topic (choose type as Standard) and provide a topic Name, 2. Create a Subscription with Email as the protocol. Entering an email address under Endpoint and clicking Create subscription finalizes the steps required in the console. The last step is to click Confirm subscription within the email sent to the email address used for the endpoint.  Figure 13: GuardDuty SNS email</p> <p></p> <p>Figure 14: SNS subscription confirmation</p> <p>The basis of EventBridge is to create rules that route events to a target. In this example below, a rule with an event pattern is constructed. This results in the rule being ran when an event matches the defined pattern. This rule will look for EC2 instances that exhibit SSH brute force attack behavior with the added detail of the resource being leveraged as the threat actor.</p> <p>With both the SNS topic/subscription in place, deploying this EventBridge rule will automatically send an email notification to the registered email address. It is recommended to use an email alias associated with a team when sending notifications of high severity findings.  Figure 15: GuardDuty EventBridge rule</p> <p>Tip: For more detailed instructions on how to build an EventBridge rule for GuardDuty findings that target SNS for email notification with customization, refer to this AWS Knowledge Center video.</p>"},{"location":"guides/guardduty/#automated-remediation-for-common-finding-types","title":"Automated remediation for common finding types","text":"<p>Stealth:S3/ServerAccessLoggingDisabled A common use case for automation with GuardDuty finding types is to address S3 and EC2 related findings as a result of misconfiguration (intentional or unintentional). For example, finding type Stealth:S3/ServerAccessLoggingDisabled informs you that S3 server access logging is disabled for a bucket within your AWS environment. If disabled, no web request logs are created for any attempts to access the identified S3 bucket, however, S3 management API calls to the bucket, such as DeleteBucket, are still tracked. If S3 data event logging is enabled through CloudTrail for this bucket, web requests for objects within the bucket will still be tracked. This could be the result of a misconfiguration or part of an unauthorized user\u2019s technique to evade detection.</p> <p>Using the associated finding details, an administrator can learn about the AWS resources that were involved in the suspicious activity, when this activity took place, and additional information. After gathering the information, the administrator could pivot from the finding into the S3 bucket to re-enable Server Access Logging. Remediating this automatically would save the administrator time and allow for focused investigation into how a potential threat actor was able to perform the API call.</p> <p>A common remediation approach decouples the GuardDuty detection from the automation action using an AWS Config Managed Rule to trigger on s3-bucket-logging-enabled configuration changes. Once triggered, AWS Config will immediately evaluate the S3 bucket and display a status of NON_COMPLIANT if logging is disabled. You can associate remediation actions with AWS Config rules and choose to execute them automatically to address non-compliant resources without manual intervention. In this scenario, the non-compliant s3-bucket-logging-enabled status will trigger the Systems Manager Automation document named AWS-ConfigureS3BucketLogging. By selecting Automatic remediation and AWS-ConfigureS3BucketLogging as your Remediation action detail when configuring your AWS Config rule Action, S3 server access logging will be re-enabled anytime a S3 bucket is non-compliant to the Config rule.</p> <p></p> <p>Figure 16: GuardDuty finding automation</p> <p>Backdoor:EC2/C&amp;CActivity.B EC2 instances querying an IP address that is associated with a known command and control server is another common use case for automated remediation. This finding informs you that the listed instance within your AWS environment is querying an IP associated with a known command and control (C&amp;C) server. The listed instance might be compromised. This type of finding has multiple steps towards remediations, that may include actions like performing a snapshot of the volume(s) before terminating the instance. This snapshot can provide information to a forensics team. However, the first step in remediating this finding is to isolate the instance.</p> <p>The same event workflow described in the Automated Notifications section can be utilized to change the security group of the instance to stop inbound/outbound connections to the internet. An AWS Lambda function would be the target of an EventBridge rule set to match on Backdoor:EC2/C&amp;CActivity.B. (An EventBridge can support multiple targets; a best practice for this scenario would also include an SNS topic target) Here is an example Lambda function written Python to perform this task:</p> <pre><code>import boto3\n\nec2_client = boto3.client('ec2')\n\ndef lambda_handler(event, context):\n    try:\n        # Check if the event is triggered by GuardDuty finding\n        if 'detail' in event and 'type' in event['detail'] and event['detail']['type'] == 'Backdoor:EC2/C&amp;CActivity.B':\n            # Extract relevant information from the GuardDuty finding\n            instanceId = event['detail']['resource']['instanceDetails']['instanceId']\n            SecurityGroupId = \"sg-XXXXXXXXXXXX\"  # Replace with the desired Security Group ID\n\n            # Construct the modification command\n            command = {\n                'InstanceId': instanceId,\n                'Groups': [SecurityGroupId]\n            }\n\n            # Send the command to modify the EC2 instance's security group\n            ec2_client.modify_instance_attribute(**command)\n\n            return 'Updated security group for instance: {}'.format(instanceId)\n        else:\n            return 'No action taken.

Since GuardDuty relies on the Route 53 resolver to know where how to find the GuardDuty VPC endpoint this can cause an issue with the VPC endpoint configuration. Although we recommend using the AWS managed DNS resolver for recursive DNS, some customers decide to use a custom DNS resolver. To fix this issue while still using your custom DNS server you have two options:</p> <p>Option 1: The best option is to leave the \u201cEnable DNS resolution\u201d box checked so that GuardDuty can use the Route 53 resolver to find the GuardDuty VPC endpoint. The DHCP option set that you have configured for your custom DNS server will have set the resolver.conf file for your hosts so that they use your custom DNS server. The GuardDuty agent will use the .2 resolver option. To enable the Route 53 DNS Resolver in your VPC follow the steps below.</p> <ul> <li>Visit the Amazon VPC Console. </li> <li>Select the VPC that you want to change the DNS settings.</li> <li>In the top right corner use the Actions drop down and click edit VPC settings</li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li>Once you\u2019re on the VPC settings page make sure the Enable DNS resolution box is checked. This will enable Route53 DNS Resolver for this VPC.</li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li>If you have configured a custom DNS server because you want to limit traffic that can use the Route 53 resolver then you can use Route 53 DNS firewall to allow resolution to the GuardDuty endpoint and nothing else. To do this you will need to make two rules in your Route 53 DNS firewall policy. The rule with the top priority will allow resolution to \u201cguardduty-data..amazonaws.com\u201d. The rule that will follow in rule evaluation priority should deny \u201c.\u201d. The combination of these rules will allow resolution to the GuardDuty endpoint through the Route 53 resolver, while denying any other resolution. (GuardDuty is also monitoring this Route53 resolver traffic for suspicious) activity.* <p>Option 2: If you\u2019re using a centralized endpoint VPC architecture you can create an entry in your custom DNS server to resolve the GuardDuty endpoint. To do this you will need to check the endpoint specific to your central VPC that the GuardDuty agent is trying to resolve and then add that as your DNS entry.</p>"},{"location":"guides/guardduty/#troubleshooting-ecs-task-execution-role-errors","title":"Troubleshooting ECS Task Execution Role Errors","text":"<p>If you see issue type Agent exited and additional information error message that says CannotPullContainerError this is likely caused by insufficient IAM permissions for the ECS Fargate task execution role.

Amazon Inspector continues to assess your environment throughout the lifecycle of your resources by automatically monitoring resources in response to changes that could introduce a new vulnerability, such as: installing a new package in an Amazon EC2 instance, installing a patch, and when a new common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE) that impacts the resource is published. Unlike traditional security scanning software, Amazon Inspector has minimal impact on the performance of your fleet.</p> <p>Amazon Inspector creates a finding when it discovers a software vulnerability, code vulnerability, or network configuration issues. A finding describes the vulnerability, identifies the affected resource, rates the severity of the vulnerability, and provides remediation guidance. Amazon Inspector also provide an Amazon Inspector score that provides context into the severity of a vulnerability. Visit the Inspector documentation to learn more about the Amazon Inspector score. You can analyze findings using the Amazon Inspector console, or view and process your findings through other AWS services.</p> <p>Integration with Organizations enables you to quickly deploy and see vulnerability posture across all of their accounts from a single location and verify that Amazon inspector is automatically enabled and performing assessments as new accounts are added to the organization.

For example, if you select 60 days for push date, and 180 days for pull date configurations, Amazon Inspector will continue to monitor images if they were pushed in the last 60 days or if they have been pulled at least once in the last 180 days. We recommend understanding the application deployment patterns at your organization when deciding the re-scan duration settings. For example if you build images often you might want shorter scan durations. Also, if you utilize ECR lifecycle policies this might affect how long images exist in ECR. For detailed instructions on how to set this duration please refer to the ECR automated re-scan duration documentation.</p> <p> Figure 10: Inspector ECR scan settings</p>"},{"location":"guides/inspector/#lambda-scanning","title":"Lambda Scanning","text":"<p>Lambda scanning has two different functionalities.

If you're not familiar, CIS Benchmarks from the Center for Internet Security (CIS) are a set of globally recognized and consensus-driven best practices to help security practitioners implement and manage their cybersecurity defenses. Developed with a global community of security experts, the guidelines help organizations proactively safeguard against emerging risks. Companies implement the CIS Benchmark guidelines to limit configuration-based security vulnerabilities in their digital assets. Just like you can check your AWS environment against CIS Benchmarks using AWS Security Hub, Inspector allows you to run CIS Benchmarks against your operating systems in AWS.</p> <p>Start by familiarizing yourself with the necessary requirements for running CIS scans such as the need for deep scanning to be enabled and an SSM agent to be present on an instance.</p> <p>Next, we recommend you think about your desired outcome for CIS scans before configuration. For example, you should answer questions before configuration such as what we have listed below, which is not an exhaustive list. This will help you get the most out of your CIS scans without creating extra findings that don't help with your overall security goals.</p> <ul> <li>How often do we build images?

Inspector findings are also stateful. This means that if you update a package that contained a vulnerability Inspector will see the package change, initiate an assessment, and if the vulnerability was in fact remediated then close the finding. This understanding is important for understanding you will handle Inspector findings. Below will dive into some of the different themes we think you should be thinking through.</p> <ol> <li>A critical component of an effective vulnerability management program is the ability to assess and prioritize security findings. This is where pulling in context, organizational history, and tuning detection systems comes into place. Prioritization of security findings helps establish the appropriate speed for response level. We recommend prioritizing the investigation of all critical and high severity findings.</li> <li>Understand what you will do with findings when they are created by Inspector. For example, Amazon Inspector has 5 different finding severity levels described here. It is important to understand how quickly you will require teams in your organization to remediate findings. This is likely to depend on severity, as you will want to more quickly respond to critical findings vs informational findings.</li> <li>After understanding response times, it is important to focus on how you will alert on new vulnerabilities. For example, do you have a ticketing system that you would like to integrate with? If so, this is something that AWS Security Hub can assist with. You might want to send these alerts directly to applications teams for remediation, or maybe they need to be cleared through security first. With Inspectors integration with Amazon EventBridge and AWS Security Hub you have many different alerting and tracking options. It is important to understand what works best for your organization and to have this workflow established.</li> <li>Remediation of vulnerabilities should be pushed to application owners as they are the ones who understand the implications of updating packages used by their application code. It would be an anti-pattern for security teams to be responsible for software patching. A two-way communication channel between the security teams should be established for communicating risk, its acceptance and/or mitigation.</li> <li>Ideally at every organization we want to automate as much as possible to save time and potential errors associated with repetitive manual actions from humans. Unfortunately, this can\u2019t also be done 100% of the time, but we should always be working to get there. First work through what services you will use to automate vulnerability remediation such as AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager. Then understand what environments, resources, and CVEs you feel comfortable automatically remediating. The amount of automation that can be created will largely depend on resource timing and ability. There will be an intersection where risk is not great enough to constitute how much time you spent on furthering automation versus working on other high priority projects. Once you start to build this out there are a lot of different resources that can help with automating patch management in AWS. Since there are a number of different resources on this, we have created a dedicated section in the resources section below of valuable resources that you should look at.</li> <li>In addition to automating where possible many customers use Amazon Inspector to find vulnerabilities in resources early in the development lifecycle and remediate before being deployed in a production environment. Using Amazon Inspector in development and staging accounts during development and testing give you the visibility to understand what vulnerabilities exist in applications before deploying to production. There are also multiple blogs that cover how Inspector fits into a CI/CD pipeline in the resources section.</li> </ol> <p> Figure 15: Inspector finding flow</p>"},{"location":"guides/inspector/#software-bill-of-materials-sbom-configuration","title":"Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) Configuration","text":"<p>In Amazon Inspector you can export a Software Bill of Materials or SBOM for short. If you\u2019re not familiar an SBOM it is a nested inventory of all the open source and third-party software components of your codebase. This can help you gain visibility into information about your software supply, such as your commonly used packages, and associated vulnerabilities across your organization.</p> <p>To export SBOMs you need to use the Console or API set this up. Steps on how to configure this can be found in the Inspector SBOM documentation. It is important to keep in mind that this is a one-time export. If you need to do this on a regular basis it is recommended to set up a Lambda Function that uses the create sbom export API on a regular schedule to automatically create these SBOMs. This will help you if you need to look at an SBOM you have an update to date SBOM. This could also be event driven, for example running an SBOM export for an instance when it is created.</p> <p> Figure 16: Inspector SBOM settings</p>"},{"location":"guides/inspector/#suppression-rules","title":"Suppression Rules","text":"<p>You might have CVEs in your environment that are not applicable because of a compensating control or that you\u2019re unable to remediate and have categorized them as an accepted risk. For these circumstances you can create suppression rules in Inspector. You can use suppression rules to automatically exclude Amazon Inspector findings that match specified criteria. For example, you can create a rule to suppress all findings with a low vulnerability score. Suppression rules don't have any impact on the finding itself and don't prevent Amazon Inspector from generating a finding. Suppression rules are only used to filter your list of findings. If Amazon Inspector generates a new finding that matches a suppression rule, the service automatically sets the status of the finding to Suppressed. The findings that match suppression rule criteria won't appear in the console by default.</p> <p>Additionally, if you are using AWS Security Hub as your aggregation point for Inspector in other AWS security services you can use automation rules to address findings. For example, you can use automation rules to upgrade all findings for a particular production account to a severity that warrants an immediate action or downgrades the severity of findings for particular environments that have controls in place that don\u2019t allow public resources.

To verify that you are using Inspector cost effectively it is important to understand that since it is usage based you should make sure you do not have extra resources in your environment that are not being used. This will not only save Inspector cost but will potentially save you on Amazon EC2, ECR, and Lambda costs. Secondly each scanning function of Amazon Inspector is optional, so you can choose to use what you need. It is not recommended to disable any of the features as this could potentially cause a lack of visibility into vulnerabilities in your environment and introduce unnecessary challenges, but at every organization there is budgets limits that should be taken into consideration when using Amazon Inspector features. Another option that can be used but should be carefully evaluated is the tag that can be used to exlude scanning for EC2 instances. For more information on how to configure this tag please refer to the scanning Amazon EC2 Instances documentation.</p> <p>The best way to estimate costs with Amazon Inspector is to take advantage of the 15-day free trial.

It supports thousands of rules, and the rules can be based on port, protocol, and FQDN/domain. AWS Network Firewall supports rules written in Suricata format, giving you the ability to create customized rules based on specific network traffic characteristics, such as packet size or byte match pattern. Network Firewall also offers AWS Managed domain lists and threat signatures so you don\u2019t have to worry about writing and maintaining your own Suricata IPS rules.</p>"},{"location":"guides/network-firewall/#getting-started","title":"Getting started","text":"<p>In this section we will cover what you need to consider before activating AWS Network Firewall in your AWS infrastructure.</p>"},{"location":"guides/network-firewall/#deployment-considerations","title":"Deployment Considerations","text":"<p>When customers first start deploying AWS Network Firewall, they might be tempted to start configuring it right away without looking at all its capabilities, for example deploying endpoints to each VPC, only using managed rules or not using Alert rules. We recommend looking into the Network Firewall documentation as this could be a significant time-saver later down the road.</p> <p>To get started you should understand the three main architecture patterns for Network Firewall deployments and what would be best suite your environment.</p> <ul> <li>Distributed deployment model \u2014 Network Firewall is deployed into each individual VPC.</li> <li>Centralized deployment model \u2014 Network Firewall is deployed into a centralized VPC attached to an instance of AWS Transit Gateway for East-West (VPC-to-VPC) or North-South (inbound and outbound from internet, on-premises) traffic. We refer to this VPC as the inspection VPC.</li> <li>Combined deployment model \u2014 Network Firewall is deployed into a centralized inspection VPC for East-West (VPC-to-VPC) and a subset of North-South (on-premises, egress) traffic. Internet ingress is distributed to VPCs that require dedicated inbound access from the internet, and Network Firewall is deployed accordingly.</li> </ul> <p>See the Deployment models for AWS Network Firewall blog post for further details about deployment models.</p>"},{"location":"guides/network-firewall/#implementation","title":"Implementation","text":"<p>In this section we will cover the minimum requirements for deploying AWS Network Firewall.</p> <p>To deploy Network Firewall, you just need one VPC, one subnet, but for resiliency we highly recommend a firewall endpoint/subnet be deployed for each AZ that you have workloads in.</p> <p></p> <p>Figure 1: Network Firewall VPC Configuration settings</p> <p>If you want to encrypt the Network Firewall configuration data at rest with your own key, you will need to specify a KMS key.</p> <p></p> <p>Figure 2: Network Firewall CMK Configuration</p> <p>For more information on deployment refer to the getting started with Network Firewall documentation</p> <p>If you're implementing AWS Network Firewall into a production environment where you want the least amount of traffic disruption, we recommend you set the Stream exception policy option to \"Continue\" or \"Reject\" and that you not have any default block actions. The Stream exception policy option of \"Drop\" can be more disruptive to production traffic since it silently blocks mid stream flows and does not send a TCP Reset.</p>"},{"location":"guides/network-firewall/#operationalizing","title":"Operationalizing","text":""},{"location":"guides/network-firewall/#ensure-symmetric-routing","title":"Ensure Symmetric Routing","text":"<p>Network Firewall does not support Asymmetric routing so you will need to ensure symmetric routing is configured in your VPC. When you deploy Network Firewall into a VPC, you need to modify the route tables to ensure traffic is sent through firewall endpoints so that it can be inspected. Network Firewall does not support asymmetric routing so the route tables have to account for network flows going to the firewall endpoint in both directions.</p> <p>When using AWS Transit Gateway (TGW) in a centralized deployment configuration and using Network Firewall to inspect East-West traffic between VPCs, the TGW\u2019s appliance mode option needs to be enabled for the attachments in the Inspection VPC. The appliance mode can be enabled in the AWS Console, as well as the API.</p> <p>If appliance mode is not enabled, the return path traffic could land on an endpoint in a different AZ, which will prevent the Network Firewall from correctly evaluating the traffic against the firewall policy.</p>"},{"location":"guides/network-firewall/#use-strict-rule-ordering-and-drop-established-or-application-drop-established-with-corresponding-alert-default-actions","title":"Use Strict rule ordering and 'Drop established' or 'Application drop established' with corresponding 'Alert' default actions","text":"<ul> <li>In Network Firewall there are two options for how the Suricata engine is going to process rules.</li> <li>The \"Strict\" option is recommended because it instructs Suricata to process the rules in the order you have defined.</li> <li>The \"Action Order\" option supports Suricata's default rule processing which is appropriate for IDS use cases but is not a good fit for typical firewall use cases.</li> <li>When selecting Strict rule ordering you are also able to select \"Default\" actions that are run at the end of your rules and will be applied to any traffic not matching earlier rules.

You may need custom rules to allow these packets. See the Evaluation order for stateful rule groups documentation for details.</p> <p>Alternatively, the Egress Default Block Rules in the custom Suricata rules template included in this guide apply the same application-layer-aware drop strategy using custom rules, without requiring separate rules for TCP flow control packets.</p>"},{"location":"guides/network-firewall/#use-stateful-rules-over-stateless-rules","title":"Use Stateful rules over Stateless rules","text":"<ul> <li>Stateless rules should be used very sparingly because they can easily cause asymmetric flow forwarding issues (where only one side of the flow is seen by the stateful inspection engine of the firewall) and they tend to make the overall firewall ruleset more complex to understand and troubleshoot.

It\u2019s a straightforward and simple way to monitor and control TLS traffic without the need for resolving domains to IP addresses, which can be unreliable and also opens up a potential vulnerability since CDNs are so commonly used for website hosting, and allowing access to a CDN\u2019s IP allows access to all domains hosted on the CDN, if the client is able to craft forged requests. SNI filtering also has a similar limitation, in that if a client is able to craft forged requests, the request could claim to be going to a legitimate domain, but actually connect to an illegitimate IP address instead. In both of these client side SNI manipulation cases a prerequisite is that the system is already to some extent compromised.</p> <ul> <li>So how do we address this?</li> </ul> <p>First and foremost, we concentrate on reducing the likelihood that the workload could be compromised to the extent that SNI manipulation could occur. Leveraging AWS Network Firewall\u2019s Managed Rules, is a good place to start since they block well-known high risk threats. Many AWS customers start here, and then also move towards a least privilege security model where only a short list of legitimate domains is allowed, and all others are blocked by default. A domain allow-list reduces the risk surface substantially, again, further reducing the opportunity for a workload to be compromised and able to be used to send forged requests.</p> <ul> <li>But what if I want to directly block client side SNI manipulation with AWS Network Firewall?</li> </ul> <p>That can be accomplished by enabling AWS Network Firewall\u2019s TLS decryption feature. When TLS decrypt is enabled, client side SNI manipulation is blocked by default and this error message is displayed in the firewall\u2019s TLS log:</p> <pre><code>{\n    \"firewall_name\": \"NetworkFirewall\",\n    \"availability_zone\": \"us-east-1a\",\n    \"event_timestamp\": 1727451885,\n    \"event\": {\n        \"timestamp\": \"2024-09-27T15:44:45.321222Z\",\n        \"src_ip\": \"10.2.1.145\",\n        \"src_port\": \"39038\",\n        \"dest_ip\": \"44.193.128.70\",\n        \"dest_port\": \"443\",\n        \"sni\": \"spoofedsni.com\",\n        \"tls_error\": {\n            \"error_message\": \"SNI: spoofedsni.com Match Failed to server certificate names: checkip.us-east-1.prod.check-ip.aws.a2z.com/checkip.us-east-1.prod.check-ip.aws.a2z.com/checkip.amazonaws.com/checkip.check-ip.aws.a2z.com \"\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>But what other options do I have to block client side SNI manipulation?</li> </ul> <p>It\u2019s possible to add both SNI Domain checks and DNS Domain-to-IP checks so that SNI requests are only allowed out to IP addresses that are associated with the domain in DNS. This is an example solution that accomplishes this with Network Firewall. Both of these solutions above have downsides in added cost and/or complexity, so we recommend customers first start by moving towards a Domain Allow-List, and then determine if the workload\u2019s security requirements dictate that more controls should be added.</p> <p>Another capability Network Firewall has in combating TLS SNI spoofing is JA3 filtering. You can think of JA3 as similar to an HTTP User-Agent, but for TLS, and not easily configurable. You can learn more about JA3 here.

Now in order for SNI spoofing to be successful, not only would the client system need to be compromised to the extent that special commands could be crafted and launched from it, but now the attacker would have to have such deep control of the system that they could even manipulate the specific client agents/processes to make connections out to a domain on the allow-list.</p> <p>Another option is to not be so strict, but instead allow only the 3 JA3s to access any of the SNIs like this:</p> <pre><code>alert tls $HOME_NET any -&gt; any any (ja3.hash; content:\"7a15285d4efc355608b304698cd7f9ab\"; flowbits:set,ja3_allowed; noalert; sid:11111;)\nalert tls $HOME_NET any -&gt; any any (ja3.hash; content:\"1be8360b66649edee1de25f81d98ec27\"; flowbits:set,ja3_allowed; noalert; sid:22222;)\nalert tls $HOME_NET any -&gt; any any (ja3.hash; content:\"fd75aaca18604d62f2bc8b02b345140f\"; flowbits:set,ja3_allowed; noalert; sid:33333;)\npass tls $HOME_NET any -&gt; any any (tls.sni; content:\"ssm.us-east-1.amazonaws.com\"; nocase; flowbits:isset,ja3_allowed; sid:44444;)\npass tls $HOME_NET any -&gt; any any (tls.sni; content:\"ssmmessages.us-east-1.amazonaws.com\"; flowbits:isset,ja3_allowed; nocase; sid:55555;)\npass tls $HOME_NET any -&gt; any any (tls.sni; content:\"ec2.us-east-1.amazonaws.com\"; nocase; flowbits:isset,ja3_allowed; sid:66666;)\nreject tls $HOME_NET any -&gt; any any (msg:\"TLS not on domain/JA3 allow-list blocked\"; flow:to_server; sid:77777;)\n</code></pre> <p>The above two options have drawbacks in that they require that any time there is a client agent upgrade the new JA3 hash be added to the allow-list before it'll work. This is added complexity for added security value.</p> <p>But how can we allow for a little bit of flexibility to ease the management of the allow-lists while still continuing to reduce the risk surface?</p> <p>Another option is to track which destination IPs have been contacted by approved JA3 hashes, remember them for a period of time, and then only let our TLS domain allow list work out to those higher trust destination IPs. Here is what that ruleset might look like:</p> <pre><code>alert tls $HOME_NET any -&gt; any any (ja3.hash; content:\"7a15285d4efc355608b304698cd7f9ab\"; xbits:set, allowed_ja3_destination_ips, track ip_dst, expire 21600; sid:11111;)\nalert tls $HOME_NET any -&gt; any any (ja3.hash; content:\"1be8360b66649edee1de25f81d98ec27\"; xbits:set, allowed_ja3_destination_ips, track ip_dst, expire 21600; sid:22222;)\nalert tls $HOME_NET any -&gt; any any (ja3.hash; content:\"fd75aaca18604d62f2bc8b02b345140f\"; xbits:set, allowed_ja3_destination_ips, track ip_dst, expire 21600; sid:33333;)\npass tls $HOME_NET any -&gt; any any (tls.sni; content:\"ssm.us-east-1.amazonaws.com\"; nocase; xbits:isset, allowed_ja3_destination_ips, track ip_dst; sid:44444;)\npass tls $HOME_NET any -&gt; any any (tls.sni; content:\"ssmmessages.us-east-1.amazonaws.com\"; xbits:isset, allowed_ja3_destination_ips, track ip_dst; nocase; sid:55555;)\npass tls $HOME_NET any -&gt; any any (tls.sni; content:\"ec2.us-east-1.amazonaws.com\"; nocase; xbits:isset, allowed_ja3_destination_ips, track ip_dst; sid:66666;)\nreject tls $HOME_NET any -&gt; any any (msg:\"TLS not on domain/A3 allow-list blocked\"; flow:to_server; sid:77777;)\n</code></pre> <p>The above option will let a new JA3 seen access the TLS domain allow list, but only if the request is going to an IP that an approved JA3 has already been talking to. This can provide some flexibility without providing too much flexibility. Each customer will have to determine if their specific application's threat model justifies the added overhead of maintaining a JA3 allow-list. Most AWS Network Firewall customers are satisfied with the significant risk reduction of a domain allow-list, and don't find it necessary to also lock down the domains to an allow-list of JA3 hashes too.</p>"},{"location":"guides/network-firewall/#resources","title":"Resources","text":""},{"location":"guides/network-firewall/#workshops","title":"Workshops","text":"<ul> <li>AWS Network Firewall Workshop</li> <li>Egress Controls Workshop</li> </ul>"},{"location":"guides/network-firewall/#videos","title":"Videos","text":"<ul> <li>Introduction, Best Practices and Custom Suricata Rules</li> <li>AWS Network Firewall console experience</li> <li>Decrypt, inspect, and re-encrypt TLS egress traffic at scale</li> <li>Decrypt, inspect, and re-encrypt TLS traffic at scale</li> <li>AWS Network Fireall Suricata HOME_NET variable override</li> <li>AWS Network Firewall support for reject action for TCP traffic</li> <li>AWS Network Firewall tag-based resource groups</li> <li>AWS re:Inforce 2023 - Firewalls, and where to put them (NIS306)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"guides/network-firewall/#blogs","title":"Blogs","text":"<ul> <li>Deployment models</li> <li>Cost considerations and common options for AWS Network Firewall log management</li> <li>TLS inspection configuration for encrypted traffic and AWS Network Firewall</li> <li>How to control non-HTTP and non-HTTPS traffic to a DNS domain with AWS Network Firewall and AWS Lambda</li> <li>Use AWS Network Firewall to filter outbound HTTPS traffic from applications hosted on Amazon EKS and collect hostnames provided by SNI</li> <li>How to deploy AWS Network Firewall by using AWS Firewall Manager</li> <li>Introducing Prefix Lists in AWS Network Firewall Stateful Rule Groups</li> <li>How to analyze AWS Network Firewall logs using Amazon OpenSearch Service \u2013 Part 1</li> <li>How to analyze AWS Network Firewall logs using Amazon OpenSearch Service \u2013 Part 2</li> </ul>"},{"location":"guides/network-firewall/#sample-code","title":"Sample Code","text":"<ul> <li>AWS Network Firewall CloudWatch Dashboard</li> <li>AWS Network Firewall Automation Examples</li> </ul>"},{"location":"guides/security-hub/","title":"Security Hub","text":""},{"location":"guides/security-hub/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>Welcome to the AWS Security Hub Best Practices Guide.

Security Hub collects findings from the security services enabled across your AWS accounts, such as threat detection findings from Amazon GuardDuty, vulnerability findings from Amazon Inspector, and sensitive data findings from Amazon Macie. Security Hub also collects findings from partner security products using a standardized AWS Security Finding Format, eliminating the need for time-consuming data parsing and normalization efforts. Customers can designate an administrator account that can access all findings across their accounts.</li> <li>Accelerate mean time to resolution with automated response and remediation actions. Create custom automated response, remediation, and enrichment workflows using the Security Hub integration with Amazon EventBridge, and other integrations to create Security Orchestration Automation and Response (SOAR) and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) workflows.

This configuration policy will enable you to specify what accounts, organizational units, or regions have Security Hub enabled and also which standards you want enabled. The default policy options will select all regions, all accounts, enable the AWS Foundational Security Best Practices standard, and enable this same configuration for any new accounts added in the AWS Organization. This will ensure you don\u2019t have a lack of visibility and save you manual effort of enabling Security Hub individually for accounts in your organization moving forward. Using central configuration will also set the finding aggregation to your region that was used when setting the central configuration.</p> <p> Figure 1: Security Hub accounts page</p> <p>You can choose to not use central configuration and instead use Local configuration to new organization accounts, but with this feature you must configure settings manually in each account and region.

For example, one of the most common customer uses cases is to elevate findings severity for top production accounts where you need to focus on, rather than the same findings identified on developers account. You can elevate the severity level of findings related to the production account IDs to a higher severity or you can lower the severity of the findings related to developers account IDs so your team can only focus on the important findings. Another use case is to use resource tags to further understand what resources are associated with a finding and what you want the automation rule to do with the finding.</p> <p> Figure 8: Security Hub Automation Rules page</p> <p>Here are some examples when it comes to automation rules:</p> <ul> <li>Change findings severity from HIGH to CRITICAL if the findings affect specific production accounts.</li> <li>Change the Security Hub findings with \u2018Informational\u2019 severity label to \u201cSuppressed\u201d workflow status.</li> <li>Set finding severity to CRITICAL if the finding\u2019s resource ID refers to a specific resource (for example, S3 buckets with PII).</li> </ul> <p>For example, let\u2019s say we created an automation rule to elevate severity of a finding for production environments from high to critical and then If a criteria is matched as part of this automated rule, an automated action will be taken as shown in the image below where the finding severity will be raised from high to critical.</p> <p> Figure 9: Security Hub Automation Rule</p> <p>Here are some considerations when it comes to automation rules:</p> <ul> <li>Including a rule description allows teams to provide context to responders and resource owners.</li> <li>Only the Security Hub admin account can create, delete, edit, and view automation rules.</li> <li>Automated remediation must be created in each region in Security Hub admin account.</li> <li>Define criteria and include member account ids.</li> <li>Security Hub updates control findings every 12-24 hours or when the associated resource changes state.</li> <li>Rule order matters - multiple rules may apply to same finding or finding field.

This gives you the ability to access the Security Lake console in one region and configure log collection across all of your desired regions. We recommend enabling Security Lake in all regions, even those you are not actively using. Security Lake is a pay as you go service. So, since it will collect next to no data in unused regions, it remains cost effective to enable Security Lake in all regions.

A rollup region is a region you choose to receive a copy of security data from \u201ccontributing regions\u201d that you specify. To elaborate on this point it is important to remember that although S3 bucket names are globally unique the data stored in S3 is specific to a region. When configuring Security Lake a separate bucket is created for each region you are collecting logs in. Using rollup regions, you can have contributing regions \u201crollup\u201d their data to your rollup region bucket allowing all of your logs to be stored in the region you specify. This can provide needed flexibility for data residency requirements. Note that data from the rollup region is replicated, not moved. If you\u2019d like to minimize duplicative data you can use a storage class transition for the contributing region to set an expiration period for the data. We recommend setting the expiration period to a comfortable length based on your own risk profile and control environment. For example, some customers find an expiration period of 3 days is the appropriate balance between cost and the risk of lost logs since it\u2019s long enough to cover an issue that occurs over the weekend.
